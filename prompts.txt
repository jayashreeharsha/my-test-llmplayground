User: can you please copy code action button next Generate code button. Also user clicks view code , it should generate code based on current model parameters and with latest last message in current coversation
User: nope. Keep View code button as it to generate code in curl and python sdk . But copy code botton should be palaced next to curl | python place holders
User: nope . view code button should be placed in current copy code button postion and inside of it , there should be copy code as it was originally
